Delezenne Quentin - Duchiron Benjamin

This repository contains all the work of the group in the course LARM.

# In **master**
This master branch contains all the work, including the tutorials and the drafts.

The aim of this work, during this course, is to take the control of a robot thought ROS and to code the navigation and the vision. We consider the behavior of the robot with the roadmap chosen, and we use the vision as a detection of object thanks to an HSV code and the Haar method.

- **In challenge1** ,there is the first part of the project with a basic navigation system. This branch contains the simulation and the real application.
This basic system functions just with simple rebounds.

- **In challenge2**, there is all the part about the vision of the robot. With two aspects : the first with an HSV code for the orange bottles and the second the haar method for the black bottles.

- **In challenge3**, there is the final part. This branch contains the code to move the robot and to use the vision for the detection of bottles. Moreover, we can find the simulation of the code A*.
